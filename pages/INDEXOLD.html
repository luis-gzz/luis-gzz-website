	   <h3>Who am I?</h3>
        
        <p>
            Hello. My name is Luis Gonzalez and I am a second year student at the Georgia Institute of Technology.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p>  
            Here at Georgia Tech I am currently studying to earn a BA in Computer Science. I chose to pursue an CS degree because I have always been fascinated with learning new computer languages and exploring what I can create with them. My hope is that by pursuing this degree I will one day be able to be part of a team that designs the systems that carry mankind to new frontiers within the solar system and beyond. 
        </p> 
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p>  
            One of my favorite hobbies and research topics is coding and programming languages. I enjoy learning these new langauges by coding different applications and games that I myself would enjoy using, and as such the majority of the work found on this site are my apps and games. In my quest to learn every programming language ever created, I have learned and mostly mastered the following:
            
            <li>Haxe</li>
            <li>Java</li>
            <li>Lua</li>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
            <li>ReactNative</li>
            <li>HTML and CSS</li>

            This is the tale of a golden fleeced sheep named Goldy. A sheep who always took a nice stroll in the morning never expecting any trouble, but this morning was different. Men fueled by their undying greed for gold have come running into the frey seeking to kill Goldy and claim his fleece as their own.

            Trump's latest campaign slogan is a testament of his love for the moon. In fact, Trump is so enamored by it that in his bid for the presidency he has agreed to do what is necessary to save it. Trump, for no more than 5 billion dollars, has blasted of to the moon and has put that beautiful hair of his on the line to repel the pesky alien invaders! Yet as Trump fends of the invaders he does not forget to allow in some extraterrestrials that he assumes to be beneficial for the moon.
