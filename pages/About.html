            Hello. My name is Luis Gonzalez and I am a fourth year student at the Georgia Institute of Technology.
        </p>

        <p>  
            While at Georgia Tech I am studying to earn a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. I chose to pursue a CS degree because I have always been fascinated with learning new computer languages and exploring what I can create with them. My hope is that by pursuing this degree I will one day be able to be part of a team that designs the systems that carry mankind to new frontiers on Earth and beyond.

            One of my favorite hobbies is coding and learning all about new programming languages. I have come to believe that the best way to learn new langauges is by designing different applications and games that I myself would enjoy using, and as such the majority of the work found on this site are my apps and games. In my quest to learn every programming language ever created, I have learned and mostly mastered the following:
            
            <li>Java</li>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>Swift</li>
            <li>Scala</li>
            <li>C</li>
            <li>A bit of Go</li>
            <li>ReactNative</li>
            <li>HTML and CSS</li>
