            "Make the Moon Great Again!"  ----- Trump's latest campaign slogan is a testament of his love for the moon. In fact, Trump is so enamored by it that in his bid for the presidency he has agreed to do what is necessary to save it. Trump, for no more than 5 billion dollars, has blasted of to the moon and has put that beautiful hair of his on the line to repel the pesky alien invaders! Yet as Trump fends of the invaders he does not forget to allow in some extraterrestrials that he assumes to be beneficial for the moon.
